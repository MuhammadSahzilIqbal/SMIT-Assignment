    <h1>Human VS Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h1>

    <p>
      The debate between <strong>Human Intelligence</strong> and
      <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> has become one of the most
      discussed topics in the <i>21 <sup>st</sup> century</i>. While humans
      possess creativity, emotions, and ethics, AI offers speed, accuracy, and
      automation. The question remains: can machines ever truly replace humans?
    </p>

    <h2>The Rise of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence, often abbreviated as
      <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>, refers to systems or
      machines that mimic human intelligence. From self-driving cars to digital
      assistants like Siri and Alexa, AI has rapidly evolved. According to
      experts, AI will become
      <q
        >The most significant technological revolution since the invention of
        electricity</q
      >.
    </p>

    <h3>Human Qualities That AI Cannot Replace</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Creativity and Imagination</li>
      <li>Emotional Intelligence</li>
      <li>Ethical and Moral Judgement</li>
      <li>Empathy and Compassion</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages of AI Over Humans</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Faster Data Processing</li>
      <li>Reduced Human Error</li>
      <li>24/7 Availability</li>
      <li>Automation of Repetitive Tasks</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The Balance Between Human and AI</h2>

    <p>
      Instead of viewing AI as a threat, we should see it as a tool that
      complements human abilities. For instance, doctors now use AI to analyze
      medical data, but the final decision still relies on human judgement.
      Hence, the ideal future is one where <del>humans are replaced</del>
      <ins>humans collaborate with AI</ins> for better outcomes.
    </p>

    <h2>Scientific Notation Example</h2>

    <p>
      Even in science, AI helps perform complex calculations such as E = mc<sup
        >2</sup
      >
      or determining molecular formulas like H<sub>2</sub>O. These examples show
      how AI supports but does not surpass human innovation.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
      In conclusion, humans and AI both have their strengths and limitations.
      While AI excels at processing and analyzing data, human creativity and
      moral values remain unmatched. The true progress of our world lies in the
      <strong>collaboration between Human and Artificial Intelligence</strong>.
